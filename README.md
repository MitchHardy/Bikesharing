# New York CitiBike Data Analysis

## Overview of Project

### For this project we are taking a look at data from a bike program in New York City. We will use this data to determine if the same or similar business model would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. I completed this analysis through visualizations of key findings in the data to decide the whether or not it will succeed in Des Moines.

## Results:

This visualization shows a map of the top starting locations of users. The lighter circles indicate that there are less bikes being rented while the darker the circle gets shows more bikes are being rented in that location. From this map we can see that more bikes are being rented closer to the downtown area of New York City. While Des Moines is not as big as NYC we can expect similar outcomes and therefore target the downtown area for bikes to be rented.
