# New York CitiBike Data Analysis

## Overview of Project

### For this project we are taking a look at data from a bike program in New York City. We will use this data to determine if the same or similar business model would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. I completed this analysis through visualizations of key findings in the data to decide the whether or not it will succeed in Des Moines.

## Results:

This visualization shows a map of the top starting locations of users. The lighter circles indicate that there are less bikes being rented while the darker the circle gets shows more bikes are being rented in that location. From this map we can see that more bikes are being rented closer to the downtown area of New York City. While Des Moines is not as big as NYC we can expect similar outcomes and therefore target the downtown area for bikes to be rented.

Here we can see the length of checkout time users are renting the bikes for. The peak time that bikes were rented for was 5 minutes, meaning the bikes are being used for shorter distances. We can also see that the longer the trip duration shows less bikes being rented.

Similar to the last graph we saw, this visualization shows the length of checkout time for users but we've broken it out by gender. This will be really helpful to know for marketing purposes to further define our target audience. From this data we can see that Male users are outnumbering Female users in every trip duration.

This graph will be really useful for our Des Moines, Iowa bike sharing business because it shows us when users are using the bikes. This will help us plan maintenance checks on the bikes and plan for peak times during the days and week. One thing that specifically stands out in this visual is that the peak trips during the day align with typical commuting times for work, 8:00am in the morning and 5:00-6:00pm at night. This also shows that during the weekday people are specifically using this service for their work commmute.

This visual is the same as the last one we looked at but now broken out by gender. Similar to out "Checkout Times by Gender" graph earlier, we can see that again Male users dominate our demographics and are using the bikes a lot more than Female users.

Here we can see another heatmap that breaksdown the types of users who are renting the bikes and their gender. This data is very helpful for us because it tells us how people are renting bikes. From this visual we can see that most of the users are actually subscribers in the service. This specifically helps us in determining if the same business model would work in Des Moines because it would mean a steady flow of income that we can plan for. 

![This is an image](https://github.com/MitchHardy/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top_Ending_Locations.png)
In our last visualization we can see a map of the top ending locations of users. This map is very similar to the first map we looked it and many of the ending locations are the same as the starting locations. This is helpful because it shows us that the users likely won't be taking the bikes to random locations, instead they can be predictable. 

## Summary
To conlcude this analysis, there are data points that we found for and against this business model that could be used in Des Moines, Iowa. First we need to remember that we looking at two very different markets in New York City and Des Moines. Just looking at this data will not give us all the information we need to determine if this business will be successful in Des Moines. From the data we gathered we saw that the majority of the top starting and ending locations were in Manhatten and clustered together in the heart of the city. Des Moines has a much smaller downtown area with less people actually living downtown and more people living in the suburbs. Therefore we will not see the same result, however this does give us direction to target the downtown area. 

Although these are two very different markets there are some things we can take from this data that could translate to a smaller market. One would be the time of the day users are renting the bikes. This data should translate to Des Moines and we should expect to see similar time rentals during the week. Another data point to consider is the staggaring number of Male users compared to Female users. We can use this data as a starting point for our target audience. 

Overall, we have a lot of great analysis that will help start a bikesharing business in Des Moines. There are risks starting any new business as there will be with this, and although there are some concerns with the types of markets we are comparing, we are confident that by using this data we can successfully start a bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. 

We also thought that the following visualizations would be helpful to further our analysis:
- A visualization that shows a map of the top starting and ending locations of subscribeing users. This would help determine where exactly the majority of your business would be using the service. 
- We could also look at top starting and ending locations by stations which should give us the intersecting streets that users are starting their trips at and ending them.
